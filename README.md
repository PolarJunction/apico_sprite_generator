# APICO Sprite Generator

A sprite-sheet generator to allow custom NPC's to be created for the APICO Game modding API without need for a graphics editor.
Provides an intuitive character-picker interface to allow users to create a unique NPC that suits their needs.

Resulting .zip file collates and names the NPC sprite-sheets appropriately. These files can manually updated in  a graphics editor to suit the users requirements.

## Screenshots
* TBD

## Roadmap
Features that are still to be added:
* Allow the NPC name to be defined and using this to name the output files, this will make it easier to define multiple NPC's
* Provide options for animated sprites, should include bob and walk animations
* Add additional accessories, hats, glasses etc.
* Better customisation options and colour palettes for clothes, skin and hair options.
